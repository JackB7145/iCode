# iCode
This program utilizes cv2 and a facial recognition algorithm to track the amount of time spent computer programming in visual studio code. The application requires an operational camera and stable internet connection to use. The program records and sends the amount of time the user is, one, looking at the camera mounted monitor and, two, active in VScode. It sends this data to an external server that sends an email report every Monday outlining the number of hours and minutes spent each day programming and user visual studio code.
